/* At the dinner party were Lady Winslow, Doctor Marcolla, Countess Contee, Madam Natsiou, and Baroness Finch.

The women sat in a row. 
They all wore different colors and <woman 1> wore a jaunty <color 1> hat. 
<woman 2> was at the far left, next to the guest wearing a <color 2> jacket. 
The lady in <color 3> sat left of someone in <color 4>. 
I remember that <color 3> outfit because the woman spilled her <alcohol 1> all over it. 
The traveler from <location 1> was dressed entirely in <color 5>. 
When one of the dinner guests bragged about her <heirloom 1>, 
the woman next to her said they were finer in <location 1>, where she lived.

So <woman 3> showed off a prized <heirloom 5>, 
at which the lady from <location 2> scoffed, saying it was no match for her <heirloom 3>. 
Someone else carried a valuable <heirloom 4> and when she saw it, 
the visitor from <location 3> next to her almost spilled her neighbor’s <alcohol 2>. 
<woman 4> raised her <alcohol 3> in toast. 
The lady from <location 4>, full of <alcohol 4>, jumped up onto the table, 
falling onto the guest in the center seat, spilling the poor woman’s <alcohol 5>. 
Then <woman 5> captivated them all with a story about her wild youth in <location 5>.

In the morning, there were four heirlooms under the table: 
the <heirloom 1>, <heirloom 2>, the <heirloom 3>, and the <heirloom 4>.

But who owned each?"
