/** We take Nick Szabo's specification of a pork bellies futures smart contract:

  future(rightA="1 round lot pork bellies",
         rightB="$1,500.00",
         p = "for delivery in July 2002") =
      when withinPeriod(p)
          to Holder rightA   with   to Counterparty rightB
      then terminate

and implement it as a Logical Contract (LPS compilable to Ethereum) below.
