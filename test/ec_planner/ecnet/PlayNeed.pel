%; The PlayNeed representation deals with one type of need, the need
%; to play.
%; Our underlying theory of human needs consists of the following sequence:
%; (1) A need is unsatisfied.
%; (2) Given certain stimuli and an unsatisfied need, an intention
%; to satisfy the need is activated.
%; (3) The intention is acted upon.
%; (4) The need is satisfied.
%; agent has an unsatisfied need to play.

%; A story understanding program will need a detailed representation

%;
%; In our simplified representation, once an intention to
%; perform $e$ is activated, it persists until it is acted
%; upon. Intentions are represented by inertial fluents.
%; If an intention to perform $e$ is active at time point $t$,
%; the agent may or may not perform $e$ at time point $t$.
%; That is, we do not know exactly when the agent will act on the
%; intention.
%; This is a case of nondeterminism,
%; which we handle by introducing a noninertial fluent corresponding
%; to each intention fluent that
%; indicates whether the agent does or does not in fact act
%; on an intention at a given time.
%; Since each ground term of the new noninertial fluent multiplies the
%; number of models by $2^{n}$ where $n$ is the number of time points,
%; in practice we may constrain the truth value of the fluent
%; at various time points.
%; In the case of the need to play,
%; HoldsAt(ActOnIntentionToPlay(agent, outside), time)
%; represents that
%; HoldsAt(IntentionToPlay(agent, outside), time) is acted
%; upon at time.
%; Effect axioms state that
%; if an agent intends to play in an outside area,
%; the agent will have an intention to play in the outside area
%; and will no longer be in the hungry-to-play state:
